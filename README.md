# Overview:

A simple one player game in which the computer randomly generates a number between 1-100 and the user tries to add crystals together to reach the number. The number values of the crystals are hidden and only appear after you click on them. You win by matching the crystal total to the randomly generated number; you lose by going over. The game restarts once you win or lose, and generates new crystal values!
